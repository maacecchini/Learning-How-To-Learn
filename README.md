# Learning how to learn - Assignment 2 #

**Summary**

In this work I will discuss about some learning techniques that I have found the most useful during the course to attain my personal goals of being a life-long learner of math or any other general interest subjects.

I will discuss my personal experience with the following topics:

. Illusions of learning

. Sleep

. Procrastination

**Procrastination**

These are my thoughts about procrastination. As we know from the course this is one of the worst addictions people suffer, and it shows scientific evidences about that (find references, and discuss some topics).

My first advice to avoid procrastination, is to turn off all common distractions, such as the TV, emails and smart phones. An email or a text message, can distract you very easily from what you are doing, and your mind is very able to trick you with excuses such as “well this is important too, I should solve these problems first than I will come back to my studies”, but this is very difficult.

*Busyness*.In most of the jobs today, or at least at the aerospace company where I work, you can sit in front of your computer and answer emails and phone calls during the complete day. At the end, if you make a balance of your activities it is hard to say that you have really accomplished something, although it seemed that you have been busy all the time, it seems that you don’t have enough time ever. This is a clear sign of procrastination.
I looks that you are very busy and important solving many problems at the same time, but in fact, you are doing no productive job at all. It is much more easy to jump from subject to subject, than to really conclude something important that requires concentration.
Another effect or procrastination is that as you don’t have time during the week days, than you ask for more time (and money) working extra time during the week ends. In my measurements people are much more productive working on week ends, why that?
