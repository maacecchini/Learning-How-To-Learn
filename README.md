# Learning how to learn - Assignment 2 #

##Summary##

In this work I will discuss what I will profit from this course to enhance my performance at work and to attain my personal goals of being a life-long learner of math related subjects.

###1 - Procrastination###

These are my thoughts about procrastination at work. As we know from the course this is one of the worst addictions people suffer, and it shows scientific evidences about that. I strongly recommend you the book "A Mind for Numbers" from Barbara Oakley that summarizes important points scientificaly demonstrade in the references.

My first advice to avoid procrastination at work, is to turn off all common distractions, such as emails alerts and smart phones. An email or a text message, can distract you very easily from what you are doing, and your mind is very able to trick you with excuses such as “well this is important too, I should solve these problems first than I will come back to my studies”, but this is very difficult. For the managers I would suggest to keep managerial meetings at a minimum.

*Busyness*.In most of the jobs today, or at least at the aerospace company where I work, you can sit in front of your computer and answer emails and phone calls during the complete day. At the end, when you make a balance of your activities during that day is hard to say that you have really accomplished something, although it seemed that you have been busy all the time, it seems that you don’t have enough time ever. This is a clear sign of procrastination, you prefer to do easier things and fool yourself..
I looks that you are very busy and important solving many problems at the same time, but in fact, you are doing no productive job at all. It is much more easy to jump from subject to subject, than to really conclude something important that requires concentration.
Another effect of procrastination are extra-time during the weekends. As you cannot accomplish what you have to do during the weekdays due to procrastination, you ask for more time during the weekends just to finish the job. It is incredible the productivity raise during a saturday. This is a kind of active procrastination as discussed in "Chu and Choi Rethinking Procrastination: Positive Effects of “Active” Procrastination Behavior on Attitudes and Performance"

*To do lists, multi-task avoiding*. One of the most useful techniques I have found to avoid procrastination, and if you are interrupted for any reason, this eases your return to concentration are to-do lists. This also have the advantage to put your brain at work in diffuse mode finding solutions for things that will be required in the near future. This is why some of the most effective teams in my company uses the [critical chain](http://www.goldratt.co.uk/resources/critical_chain/) program management method developed by Dr Eli Goldratt  together with [scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) based techniques for execution. Using these techniques you divide your huge job in small pieces, that build over other small pieces already built. You do a weekly session for checking results and planning small tasks for the next week and on. In this way you dont became blocked or afraid to start a big and complex project such as a new aircraft design or a complex software implementation. This is exactly the same technique found in reference Boice, R. (1996). Procrastination and blocking: A novel, practical approach. Westport, CT: Praeger, concerning dividing a write project in [small chunks](http://www.academiccoachingandwriting.org/academic-writing/academic-writing-blog/vii-chunk-your-writing-project-into-small-assignments/) which is exactly what I am doing in this project.

###2- Interleaving, Sleeping, Resting and Sports###

I will discuss these topics together since, in my opinion, they are closely related, so as the sports practice as shown by Dr Terrence Sejnowski in the lectures. In my opinion these activities have something in common: they put your brain working in diffuse mode. 

When you are working hard on a problem, without finding a solution, or worst you are experiencing [Einstellung](http://dspace.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/2276/1/Einstellung-Cognition.pdf), which is being blocked in only a particular way of solving a problem without being open to better ideas, you should stop for a while, and do other activities, such as learning something else, ie interleaving, go for a jogging, or sleep. When you sleep, as shown by Dr Sejinowsky in the lectures, your brain is cleaned from the toxins wich helps it to start fresh in next morning, and, as shown in various references from Barbara's Oakley book, there many researches about the benefits of sleeping for consolidation of what you have learned, that is, chunk formation. It is also proved that your brain continues to work in diffuse mode solving problems. This is why many times we wake up with good ideas about how to solve some problems that were seen as impossible.

Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali used a similar approach to enhancing their creativity, they developed some stratagems to change their mode of thinking from foccused to difuse. After working hard on a problem, they went for a nap, and suddenly the solution is there! The explanation for this is that while interrupting ther foccused mode, the freed their diffused mode of thinking that continued working in the problem.

Also, walking, or jogging, besides being an excellent fittness exercise, puts your brain in the diffused mode.

##3 - Learning independently and life-long learning##

My motivation for pursuing this course "Learning How to Learn" was that I have tried to learn Quantum Mechanics as the basis for a Physics of Solar Cells Coursera course. I have faced tremendous difficulties because I have never learned QM in my graduation as engineer. Although the math level was not so high, very good teachers giving visualisation examples to explain the concepts, I have abandoned the course. This never happened to me before, so I decided that I should use new methods of learning.

In "Learning How to Learn", I have been introduced in an organized way to many concepts that I was already aware by another readings, or even intuitively by life experience. The course have shown extraordinary scientific evidences for every concept, so it is easy to believe.
